## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning-based approach for automated resume screening and classification. The system analyzes resumes and categorizes them based on job categories, making the recruitment process more efficient and data-driven.

## 🎯 Features

- Resume text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Machine Learning classification model
- Category prediction for new resumes
- Performance metrics and model evaluation

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine Learning algorithms and tools
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Processing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the "Updated Resume Dataset" which contains various resume categories.
